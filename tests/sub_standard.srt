1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,040
It's time for the main event!

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,250
Animal Mask vs. Macadamian Ogre, AKA, MAO!

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,120
The masked wrestler, Animal Mask,

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,000
will face off against former Judo fighter MAO!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,950
Will this bring an end to their long rivalry?

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,040
What kind of match do they
have in store for us tonight?

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,580
It's finally time...

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,500
Being a pro wrestler was
the first chapter in my life.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,580
And if I can win tonight's
world championship title match,

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,290
the second chapter in my life will begin...

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,250
It's almost time for the fight!

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,370
The world championship title bout!

13
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,700
Big Saigo, I'm monologuing.
Don't interrupt me.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Oh, I see!

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,450
So, what will you do if you win tonight?

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,620
There's mountains left for you to climb!

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,910
Yes, that's exactly right.

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,290
When I win tonight's match,
the second chapter in my life will begin.

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,080
Oh, what is it?

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,790
You're quitting pro wrestling to do MMA?

21
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,410
No, maybe Muay Thai or Capoeira?

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,330
Very well. I'll tell you... I'm going to...

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,200
Whoops, looks like we're out of time.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
Break a leg and all that.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,450
Go out there and smash up
that Macadamian Ogre guy.

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,870
Big Saigo.

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,040
He's always in a hurry.

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,540
"No Pets!!"
The second chapter in my life that will begin
when I win tonight's title match...

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,290
Is when I will live my life
surrounded by the animals I love,

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,200
and share the joy of living with animals
with people everywhere!

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,660
"Interdimensional Title Match
Animal Mask vs MAO"
Let's go, Hiroyuki.

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,200
The Macadamian Ogre!

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,330
And now, entering the ring...

34
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,580
The man who loves animals a little too much!

35
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,120
Weighing in at 198 pounds, it's Animal Mask!

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,950
It's finally time...

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,620
My rival, MAO.
A worthy opponent for my last match!

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,870
The second chapter of my life will begin
after I slam you into the mat...

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,540
...and that is!

40
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,910
Opening a pet shop!

41
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,540
Strongest warrior from another world...

42
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,330
You're as strong as ever, Mao!

43
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,540
Impressive!

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,660
However!

45
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,830
I pray you answer my call!

46
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,370
Animal Mask has climbed up onto the ropes!

47
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,830
And now he's jumped!

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,580
So has Hiroyuki!

49
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,250
Wait! They've started to glow!

50
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,410
What is this?

51
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,290
They disappeared!

52
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,290
What is this?

53
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,750
Animal Mask has disappeared!

54
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,200
Huh? What?

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,870
Are you the hero?

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,580
I am Animal Mask!

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,540
Did the hero-summoning ritual fail?

58
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,750
Why is he in his underwear?

59
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,040
Is he a pervert?

60
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,410
I don't care who you are!

61
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,870
If you've answered our call,
then you are our hero!

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,580
What's going on?

63
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,040
Another trick of Big Saigo's?

64
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,950
No... this isn't the arena.

65
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,540
So where am I?

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,250
Please, Hero, will you defeat
the evil demon beasts that stalk this land

67
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,830
as well as the Demon King?

68
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,700
Evil demon beasts?

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,450
Yes, terrifying animals called monsters...

70
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,000
Exterminate every one of them
from this land...

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,450
Hero?

72
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,120
It appears I heard you right after all.

73
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,580
You're telling me to defeat animals for you?

74
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,660
Yes. They're terrifying and disgusting beasts...

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,540
Um, Hero?

76
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,700
We can do that after you
defeat the Demon King...

77
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,580
Or at least when nobody's watching...

78
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,910
Hero... Um, Hero?

79
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,870
Hero?!

80
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,500
Winner!

81
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,910
"Wrestler x Summoning"

82
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,370
The princess's noble butt
is being shown to the world!

83
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,910
Somebody, hide her butt!

84
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,950
Defeat animals?

85
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,000
So the blood of an animal lover
that flows through my veins

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,750
forced me to give that impudent
girl a German suplex?

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,250
You bastard...

88
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,830
Hero, I understand that you're angry
about being summoned like this,

89
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,830
but you can't do that to the princess.

90
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,160
I don't know what you're talking about
with this summoning and hero nonsense!

91
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,330
But... perhaps I went too far.

92
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,830
I know!

93
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,750
Drape.

94
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,790
Stop messing around!

95
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,410
Capture him!

96
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,250
Damn!

97
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,120
I was trying to be a gentleman
and help the lady out,

98
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,200
why are they mad?

99
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,700
What kind of lunatic waves
a sword at someone like that?

100
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,120
This definitely isn't the arena.

101
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,290
It's not even night anymore.

102
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,080
Where am I?

103
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Who is that?

104
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,160
Where are his pants?

105
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
Is he a pervert?

106
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,910
We should stay away...

107
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,790
He looked over here.

108
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,200
Don't meet his gaze.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,330
Somebody go call a hunter!

110
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,750
I guess I'll just find someone
kind-looking to ask.

111
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,790
Um, excuse me... Can you tell me where I am?

112
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,120
I get it!

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,660
It's rude to ask people questions
while wearing a mask!

114
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,620
The moment I take off my mask,
I'm no longer Animal Mask--

115
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,370
I'm an ordinary man named Genzo Shibata.

116
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,250
Now no one will know...

117
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,200
Over there! That's him!

118
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,580
--Watch out! It's a pervert!

119
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,080
--What?
--Watch out! It's a pervert!

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,500
Impossible!

121
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,500
The pervert ran away!

122
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,750
After the pervert!

123
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,450
I'm not a pervert! I'm a pro wrestler!

124
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,040
I have no idea how they figured me out.

125
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,580
But don't worry, Hiroyuki.

126
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,750
I'll figure out a way out of this.

127
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,120
Sorry, Hiroyuki.

128
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,700
Forgive me for being useless...

129
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,450
Hiroyuki! I'm so glad you're here with me!

130
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,290
I don't know what I would've done
if I were here by myself.

131
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,080
I don't care about clothes! Not at all!

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,000
My goal is to find food for you tonight!

133
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,500
Bro, that pervert looks pretty buff.

134
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,660
We could sell him for a lot.

135
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:41,540
Yes. And that strange creature
would probably be worth a lot of cash.

136
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,000
You're so cute...

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,040
You there, in your underwear.

138
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,950
Wh-What?

139
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,000
Animal ears?!

140
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,330
A-And...

141
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,370
You're hungry, right?

142
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,450
Come with us and we'll give you some food.

143
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,450
An animal!

144
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,580
Do you like my hairy chest and tail?

145
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,700
You've got nowhere to go, right?

146
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,410
Do what he says...

147
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,580
Bro, this guy seems like bad news...

148
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,250
Y-Yeah...

149
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,200
So fluffy!

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,330
He's staring at you, not me!

151
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,370
W-We'll be on our way...

152
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,450
What the hell?

153
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,620
Do you want to fight?

154
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,580
You think you can beat a beastman
with your bare hands?

155
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Get 'em, bro!

156
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,000
I see... you're a beastman, huh?

157
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,290
Bro!

158
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,120
Hey, you jerk! Get off my brother!

159
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,410
Stop sniffing him!

160
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,370
Misha, this guy is crazy!

161
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,790
He's crazy!

162
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,370
We're sorry, so stop! Let him go!

163
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,500
If you don't, my bro will... my bro will...

164
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,120
What's this guy's deal?

165
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,540
He's incredibly strong!

166
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Don't worry!
You'll start to like it any second!

167
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,160
Oh, you like it when I rub you here, huh?

168
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,660
Stop it!

169
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,410
We'll pay you! Stop it! Please!

170
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,120
See? Feels good, right? Good boy...

171
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,370
Now, you're next...

172
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,790
Cat ears!

173
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,790
Shigure, give up already!

174
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,410
You're about to be sold!

175
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,290
No!

176
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,790
I don't want to live at some noble's house
and get walks and naps and free snacks!

177
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,120
Who said you were being sold to a noble?

178
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,120
If that was the deal I'd go myself.

179
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,700
But if they're willing to feed me
filet mignon every day,

180
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,290
I may be willing to let them sell me.

181
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,250
Nobody will buy a beast girl like that!

182
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,540
Let's go!

183
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:30,910
--No!

184
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,750
--A poor girl in unfortunate circumstances...
--No!

185
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,160
Stop whining and let's go!

186
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,750
It's not right for an outsider
like me to get involved.

187
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,370
And not because I'd rather pet the cat ears...

188
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,790
That tail! Those ears! Is that a wolf?

189
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,450
I've had plenty of experience touching
cats and dogs, but never a wolf!

190
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,950
A girl with cat ears is a hard thing to pass up,

191
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,290
but my priority now is the wolf ears girl!

192
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,000
Please...

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,950
All praise animal ears and animal tails!

194
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,290
That's far enough!

195
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,200
Mind your own business.

196
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,700
I don't know who you think you are,

197
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
but try anything and you'll regret it.

198
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,040
Really, who are you?

199
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,000
Edgar, he's dangerous!

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,540
He's a super-high-level pervert!

201
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,950
He just had his way with my bro...

202
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,200
What?

203
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,950
What are you doing?

204
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,200
Allow me to first correct
your misunderstanding.

205
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,950
I am not a pervert.

206
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,160
I simply love all animals
regardless of gender!

207
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,250
See? He's more dangerous than he looks!

208
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,120
Yeah. The way he dresses,
the things he says...

209
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,910
He's a pervert like none
the world has ever seen!

210
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,790
Why do you fear?

211
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know who you are,
or what reasons you may have...

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,700
No! Stop it!

213
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,000
If the wolf girl is upset, you are evil!

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,790
Damn it!

215
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,750
You pervert! We'll get you yet!

216
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,910
Come to think of it, I hadn't gotten
to pet the cat ears yet, had I?

217
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,450
Why did you have to open your mouth?!

218
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,000
You're right! I'm sorry!

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,330
Um...

220
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,580
Thank you for saving me!

221
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,080
Now I won't be sold.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,540
Don't worry. I did it because I wanted to.

223
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,250
You were about to be kidnapped
by a slaver, right?

224
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,160
No, I'd borrowed money from him, so...

225
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,660
I see.

226
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,040
You were charged absurd amounts of interest
and then sold to pay your debts.

227
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,370
No, I'm the one who said
that if I couldn't pay by the deadline

228
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,330
he could sell me instead.

229
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,330
In exchange, I told him to give me a loan
with no interest and no collateral,

230
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,000
and then cried and sobbed
in front of his shop until he gave in.

231
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,830
I intended to use that money
to start a business and get rich,

232
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,450
but it didn't work out.

233
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,120
She's a loser.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,580
What's that look?

235
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,700
I was making money for a while!

236
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:08,200
But then humans started copying me.

237
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,250
I am Genzo Shibata.

238
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,700
A pro wrestler.

239
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,080
My name is Shigure.

240
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,450
And this is Hiroyuki. My partner
and a mongrel of pure breeding.

241
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,790
Nice to meet you, too!

242
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,290
Um, I'd love to thank you
for saving me, but...

243
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,290
I'm broke.

244
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,160
But from what you said, it sounds
less like I've done a good deed

245
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,750
and more like I've committed a felony...

246
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,160
Don't worry!

247
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,580
Remember what I said about
people stealing my business model?

248
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,000
The guy who stole it was Edgar,
the guy you just saw!

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,700
See? That makes him evil, right? Right? Right?

250
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,750
Well, I guess I could count that
as a good deed, just barely.

251
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,500
So...

252
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,910
You said you were broke, right?

253
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,290
You can pay with your body instead.

254
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,450
He's a loser.

255
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,910
I'll get him...

256
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,450
It's a shame, huh?

257
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,790
You okay?

258
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,250
Damn that bastard.

259
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,410
I won't just give up...

260
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,870
I don't think there's anything you can do.

261
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,040
Got a plan?

262
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,330
Yeah. That strange creature he had.

263
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,080
Oh, that?

264
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,040
What will you do with it?

265
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,660
What else? I'll steal it!

266
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,080
Great idea! Let's do it!

267
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,120
We're gonna do it!

268
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,950
Yeah!

269
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,830
--We'll show that pervert who's boss!

270
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,290
--I have nothing but a bad feeling...
--We'll show that pervert who's boss!

271
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,540
So this is it?

272
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,500
Yes. The Hunter Guild.

273
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,950
Let's work here for a while
to make some money.

274
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,290
You seem to be really strong,

275
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,160
so there's probably lots of great jobs for you.

276
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,120
So you see,

277
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,000
I have complete confidence
in my ability to love any animal

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,160
regardless of gender, species,
or even more specifically

279
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,290
hairiness, long-hair, short-hair,
eye color, or tail length!

280
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,200
So I'd like to maintain a relationship of love

281
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,080
and caring with animals at all times!

282
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,700
What? What is he talking about?

283
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,250
And...

284
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:49,080
Even the fiercest, most violent animal will
respond to my overwhelming love for them.

285
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,040
So...

286
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,120
What do I?

287
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,870
What am I supposed to do here?

288
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,910
Trouble, Guild Master!

289
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,250
What's going on?

290
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,830
I'm saved!

291
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,700
Our party was wiped out by a cerberus pack.

292
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,910
What? Perfect.

293
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,500
Will you go too?

294
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Cerberuses are terrifying monsters...

295
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,330
What?

296
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,160
Where are they?

297
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,080
Genzo! Wait!

298
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,370
What?

299
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,120
What sort of man isn't scared of a cerberus
and instead runs out to meet them?

300
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
What a brave man.

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,330
But... I didn't understand
a word he was saying.

302
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,080
It's deep in this forest!

303
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,160
Okay!

304
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,580
I don't think I've seen you before.

305
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,000
Are you going unarmed?

306
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,620
You can borrow this if you want.

307
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,040
Fool!

308
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,700
Do I look like a wrestler
who uses weapons to you?

309
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,620
He's going to fight them unarmed?

310
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,160
How confident is he?

311
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Um, I'll borrow it...

312
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,870
Listen, we can't let them get near the town!

313
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,700
Stop them here!

314
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,580
This is bad!

315
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,160
So these are cerberuses?

316
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,790
They've got three heads!

317
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,370
That means triple the fun!

318
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,410
So there are animals like this in this world?

319
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,870
Okay, maybe they look a little strange, but...

320
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,540
Are you scared?

321
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,450
Well, calm down.

322
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,790
Hey!

323
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,660
No, let's see how he handles this.

324
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,700
Yes...

325
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,620
Cerberus!

326
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,950
They appear to be a type of dog.

327
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,870
Which means that if I can become
friends with the pack leader,

328
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,910
the others will quickly open up to me as well.

329
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,160
The leader is probably...
the one guarding the rear!

330
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,370
You?

331
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,450
Hello!

332
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,370
He ran in!

333
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,870
Gotcha!

334
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,500
He dodged them!

335
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,080
Good boy! Let's play!

336
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,950
And now for the leader!

337
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,790
Come here!

338
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,950
He pinned it!

339
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,410
What kind of move is that?

340
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,410
But there are others...

341
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,330
This is bad!

342
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,580
Should we help?

343
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,830
Stay out of this!

344
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,160
He's keeping us out of danger?

345
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,250
What a man!

346
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,500
I think I'm starting to figure him out...

347
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,540
Good boy! Good boy!

348
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,580
You like it here, huh?

349
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,660
Good boy... You're such a good boy...

350
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,160
He really pinned it with his bare hands...

351
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Like you'd pin down a lady...

352
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,830
He's like a lady killer...

353
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,120
No, he's...

354
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,000
...a demon beast killer!

355
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,660
We got enough money from the job
to get you some clothes,

356
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,950
as well as pay for an inn for a while.

357
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,410
Yeah.

358
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,250
So, what will you do now?

359
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,750
I've made my decision.

360
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,040
I want people to understand
how wonderful demon beasts are!

361
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,790
Indeed! I'll bring about a world
where demon beasts and humans

362
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,250
can understand each other!

363
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,910
That's impossible in this country.

364
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,830
No...

365
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,950
I believe I can do it.

366
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,120
So you must believe too.

367
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,870
Genzo, is the reason
you refused to be a hero...?

368
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,870
That princess demanded I defeat animals!

369
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,330
Animals and human,
beast people and humans...

370
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,620
I like it! Let me help, too!

371
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,250
Really? Then let's do this!

372
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:05,120
Let's do the best with the three of us, no,
the four of us including Hiroyuki!

373
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,750
Yes!

374
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,910
Four?

375
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,370
Who are you?

376
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,910
Next time: "Quest x Demon Beast Killer."
